# Final-Project-MAP674
This is the repository for my final project for MAP674. This project will see me incorporate the features I've learned from the assignments in MAP 674 to try to build a map and analyze it.

# Introduction
This section will introduce the final project. It introduces the topic I plan to use for the project and the initial steps to do the project.
## Topic
## First steps
The first thing I will do is create a Jupyter notebook file (`ipynb`), which creates the Python. The file will be named `Final-Project` as a `ipynb` file. I also will install Leafmap on conda, terminal, and on Python as I plan to explore the feature and apply it in the project.

On Python, I will install it by adding `pip install leafmap`. When I import it, I will likely use one of the following on <a href="https://leafmap.org/get-started/">this link</a> or add `import leafmap` into my `ipynb` file.
